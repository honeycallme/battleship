<p align="center">Please do note there WILL BE memory leaks </p>
<p align="center">
  This project uses SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2 to carry out informatio between the two players, <br>
  translatting every move into binary and sending it bit by bit. 
</p>
  
 <br>
<div align="center">

  Maps can be any name and should be in a `txt` format and MUST be formated in the following way :<br>
  `LENGTH : FIRST_SQUARE : LAST_SQUARE`
  
   where LENGTH is the length of the ship, FIRST_SQUARE and LAST_SQUARE its first and last positions. <br>
   In this file, you must have 4 ships (of lengths 2,3,4 and 5). <br>
   Otherwise there will be an error !

<h3 align="center">Usage ‚è∏Ô∏è</h3>
<br>

<div align="center">

  (Requires GCC to work)

  Start with : `make` to build project <br>
  you will now have a `battleship` binary <br>
  (feel free to move it where ever pleases you).
  <br>
  (you might need to `chmod +x battleship` to allow its execution)
  <br>
  <br>
  
  üì∫ quick tutorial:
  
  ```bash
  ./battleship <path to map> # lauches the game for player one
  # this will output you a PID (5 digit number)
  
  ./battleship <PID> <path to map> # launches the game for player two
 
  ```
  
  Now each player will have to enter a move each turn, and will have to wait for the other to do so ! <br>
  And the rest is just the game

  (so its not my fault if code looks bad af)
